# Installing DynAdjust

The steps required to install DynAdjust on your system will depend upon your operating system, and whether or not you choose to [build from source code](BUILDING.md) or install pre-built binaries. In addition, installation may require the installation (or building) of one or more prerequisite applications that are external to DynAdjust but essential for its installation and use.

The DynAdjust repository comes with a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/icsm-au/DynAdjust/blob/master/Dockerfile) which builds a DynAdjust docker image for the Linux environment each time changes are pushed to the main repository. This means if you have docker installed on your system, a DynAdjust image can be run on your system (whether Linux, Mac or Windows) within a virtual enviroment managed by docker.

To access the latest docker image, please visit the [DynAdjust repo on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/icsm/dynadjust).

Alternatively, you can pull a DynAdjust docker image from your system via:

  ``` bash
  $ docker pull icsm/dynadjust
  ```
