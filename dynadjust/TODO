  Type B uncertainties to standard uncertainties.
* Add functionality to dump to individual stn/msr files the 
  measurements that are identified as duplicates.
* Add functionality to obtain the right plate motion model 
  parameters according to location.  Currently, only the Australian
  plate motion model has been implemented.
* Move DNA file related code in dnainterop.cpp to dnaiodna.cpp.
* Add functionality to permit users to define their own colour scheme for
  plots.
* Add a new option to adjust to allow users to choose whether to save the
  state of an adjustment (default is save state to .mtx files).
* Create a thread to display progress of interpolation from grid file.
* Create a thread to display progress of transformations.
* Add an option to revert to EGM when geoid grid interpolation of a point 
  lies outside the extents of a supplied grid.
* Consider splitting up large source code files into smaller files (of 
  common functionality):
  dnaadjust.cpp is > 12,500 lines of code
  dnainterop.cpp is > 6,500 lines of code
