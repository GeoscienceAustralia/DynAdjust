# WGS84 substitutions
#
# In general the ITRS (and its realizations ITRFyy) are identical to WGS84
# at one meter level. 
# 
# Meanwhile there are two types of WGS84 realizations:
# 
# - New realizations of WGS84 based on GPS data, such as WGS84(G730, G873, 
#   G1150 and G1674). These new WGS84 realizations are coincident with ITRF at 
#   about 10-centimeter level. For these realizations there are no official
#   transformation parameters. This means that one can consider that ITRF 
#   coordinates are also expressed in WGS84 at 10 cm level. However, the most
#   recent G1674 realization adopted ITRF2008 coordinates for more than half of
#   the reference stations and velocities of nearby sites for the others. Thus, 
#   ITRF2008 and WGS84(G1674) are likely to agree at the centimeter level,  
#   yielding conventional 0-transformation parameters.

#   commonly known as DOPPLER Transit, and provided station coordinates 
#   with accuracies of about one meter. With respect to this realization
